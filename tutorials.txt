every tutorial needs:
    - explanations: what is our goal? why are we doing this? why does it work?
    - to be clear and concise while also being thorough
    - time limit of 30 minutes (or 15 with more tutorials)
    - good editing (no dead air/repetitive stuff)
    - a script
    - timestamps

        - show how to download python
        - show how to make sure python is in the file path
        - show how to download pycharm/ briefly show how to create a new project and files

tutorial 2: installing packages/ setting up the venv/ botometer demonstration
""" this tutorial will focus on downloading packages with the pycharm GUI and the terminal. It will contain a brief
    demonstration on how to use botometer pro to make calls to the twitter API """

   - first show how to make a venv/install packages with the GUI and then with the terminal
   (for those who are interested)
   - give timestamps so viewers can skip the terminal tutorial if they would like


    part 1: pycharm GUI
        - explain what a venv is and why we need/are using them
        # interpreter vs venv? what does that mean in pycharm GUI?
        - explain how to create a new venv in pycharm
        - explain how to check the current venv (project tab and bottom right)
        - explain how to install packages using the package manager in the bottom left
        - explain how to see what packages are installed using the project settings

    part 2: terminal
        - explain how to change directory (cd)
        - explain how to check if venv is in the current directory (dir)
        - explain how to delete the venv (rmdir)
        - explain what pip is
        - show how to check installed packages (pip list)
        - show how to uninstall packages (pip uninstall)

    part 3: using botometer
        - explain what botometer is/ what it is doing
        - show how to find keys from the twitter developers account
        - show how to call twitter API to get information
            - show them that id and username can be used
            - print the info to the terminal
        - remind viewers that they need elevated access, or they will be unable to make API calls
          (go back to first video)

tutorial 3: using pandas/ matplot lib
""" this tutorial will focus on how to use pandas and matplotlib to create a histogram using a dataset """

    - explain what pandas and matplot lib are/do
    - explain where the training sets are from/what they are for/what each score means
    - explain what CSV files are/why we are using them
    - explain what a dataframe is
    - show how to read from/ write to CSV files using pandas
    - remind viewers that there is a limit to the number of tweets that can be called (4000) and show them how to get
      around that (deleting parts of the botometer dictionary)
    - remind viewers that it will take time to call all of the accounts (leave it running in the background)
    - show how to create a loop that reads from the csv and calls the API
        - explain why universal and english are separate
        - explain each step, make sure to copy and paste for repetitive things
        - remind viewers that a copyable version of the code is in the text tutorial
    - show how to save info to dataframes
    - explain what a histogram is/why we are using it
    - show how to turn dataframe into a histogram
        - show how to change color of histogram
        - show how to title dataframe/axes
        - show how to resize histogram
    - show how to save histogram to png

tutorial 4: creating a logistic regression model using sklearn
""" this tutorial will focus on how to use sklearn to create a logistic regression model """

    - explain what sklearn and scipy are/ do
    - explain what a machine learning model is and what it is for
    - explain what a logistic regression model is
    - explain what confusion matrix is
    - show how to create functions to convert orgs to bots, remove outliers, and create a log reg model
    - explain what zscore is and show how to create a graph that determines the accuracy of different zscores
        - explain that higher accuracy isn't always better (if half of the accounts are outliers,
          the model is not useful)
    - show how to create the model and print accuracy to the terminal
    - show how to create a confusion matrix and save the png

tutorial 5: creating a random forest model using xgboost
""" this tutorial will focus on how to use xgboost to create a random forest model """

    - explain what xgboost is/does
    - explain what pickle is
    - explain what a random forest model is/ whether it is more or less accurate than logistic regression
    - show how to create functions to convert orgs to bots, remove outliers, and create a random forest model
    - create a graph of the zscore and accuracy
    - show how to create the model and print accuracy to the terminal
    - show how to create a confusion matrix and save the png
    - show how to save the model using pickle

   conclusion:
        - test the machine learning models with new datasets and discuss the accuracies
        - discuss successes and pitfalls of the code
        - discuss things that need improvements
        - discuss errors (systematic/random)
        - thank viewers for watching and remind them of the text tutorial
